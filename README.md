## 👋 About Me

I’m **Tejaswini Marri** — a data analyst with over five years of experience working with SQL, Python, and business intelligence tools like **Power BI** and **Tableau**. I help teams make sense of data by organizing it, automating what slows them down, and building reports that are actually useful.

I’ve worked across different environments — from on-prem databases to cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure**. Most of my projects involve **data cleaning**, **pipeline development**, **visualization**, and spotting patterns that support real decisions.

I’m currently open to data roles where I can keep building things that are clear, well-structured, and make a difference.  
📍 Based in the U.S. | 🚚 Open to relocation

When I’m not working, I like to **paint, draw, cook**, and **spend time with people who help me reset**.

**tejaswinimarri/tejaswinimarri** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on making messy data less frustrating to work with — through better queries, cleaner pipelines, and fewer manual steps.
- 🌱 Lately I’ve been learning more about automating things with Airflow, writing better Python scripts, and storing data efficiently on cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.
- 👯 I’d love to collaborate on small utilities or scripts that help people spot errors in their data, save time, or just understand what they’re looking at faster.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with building a portfolio that reflects the kind of work I actually enjoy — if you’ve done this well, I’d love to hear how.
- 💬 You can ask me about SQL, Power BI, Excel formulas I’ve probably overused, or what not to overlook when cleaning a dataset.
- 📫 Reach me at: marritejaswini0924@gmail.com  
    LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/tejaswinimarri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejaswinimarri) — I’m open to connecting with people who enjoy working with data or can share honest advice during my job search.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I paint and draw when I need a break. I’m not trying to impress anyone — it just helps me slow down and reset.
